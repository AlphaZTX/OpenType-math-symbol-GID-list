# OpenType-math-symbol-GID-list

Run
```
python glyphset.py
```
to generate `glyphset.log` and `glyphset_math.log`. The two files may be a good reference when you are creating new glyphs for a OpenType math font in [Glyph 3](https://glyphsapp.com/).

`unicode-math-table.tex` in this repository is forked from [wspr/unicode-math](https://github.com/wspr/unicode-math).
